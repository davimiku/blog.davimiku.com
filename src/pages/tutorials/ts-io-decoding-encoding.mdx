**Intended Audience**:

- Anyone who has used a TypeScript library for input parsing/validation (`io-ts`, `effect-ts`, `zod`, `joi`, `yup`, etc.) and would like to learn how these work
- People who enjoy hands-on learning by building things

**Recommended Proficiency Level**:

- Proficient with common TypeScript code, including generics
- No additional advanced feature knowledge required, every advanced topic will be introduced and explained individually

**Learning Method**:

This is a hands-on tutorial, just reading through won't get you much. You'll get the most out of it by actually firing up a code editor and following along! You can also follow along on the [TypeScript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/) for most of the tutorial (excluding unit tests).

The final/full source code is available at: [https://github.com/davimiku/ts-io-decoding-encoding](https://github.com/davimiku/ts-io-decoding-encoding)
