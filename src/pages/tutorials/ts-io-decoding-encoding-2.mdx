## Introduction

This is Part 2 of a 3 part series.

1. [Decoding](./ts-io-decoding-encoding-1)
2. Custom decoders and better errors (this article)
3. Encoding (WIP)

If you haven't started with Part 1, go ahead and check it out now! That explains the motivation behind this tutorial and the goals of what we'll accomplish.

## Custom Decoders

Currently, our users can compose together the builtin functionality, which is great! However, there are going to be times where users will want to make their own custom decoder.

This could be for one or both of the following reasons:

1. They want to decode into some type `T` that isn't supported by our builtins, such as a 3rd party type or a 1st party type
2. They want to apply their own transformation logic that helps the input data _become_ `T`

<EmphasisBox>

A concrete example I had from a previous job is that we would get data from a bunch of different vendors that had to all be normalized into the same kind of struct. In particular, the date strings were wildly different from vendor to vendor, some actually used ISO 8601 like `YYYY-MM-DD` which was amazing but others used `MM/DD/YYYY`(ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸), and if I recall some were `MM_DD_YYYY` and probably other even weirder formats.

We made a custom decoder using [io-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/io-ts) that handled all of these cases and decoded it into a [Luxon DateTime](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/), which is what we were using for date-based business logic.

Custom decoders allow for both transformation and for adapters between different libraries.

</EmphasisBox>

We'll start by adding a new possibility for the runtime tag:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```typescript
type ShapeTag =
// ...snip...
  | 'custom'
```

and add a new shape to use this new tag:

```typescript
interface ShapeCustom<T> extends Shape<T> {
  readonly __tag: 'custom'
}
```

Recall that `T` here is the return type of the `decode` function, so there's no constraints because our users can use this to decode into any type.

We can add another case to the bottom of the `Infer<Shape>` type:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```typescript
export type Infer<S extends Shape<unknown>> = S extends ShapeUnknown
// ...snip...
            : S extends ShapeCustom<infer T>
              ? T
              : never
```

If the user is inferring from a custom decoder, we'll already know what type it is because they provided it when defining the custom decoder. Typically, this would be used much because a custom decoder would most likely be for a type that already exists, so it doesn't need to be inferred.

Since we're not exporting any of the shape interfaces directly (to keep the tag private so there's no shenanigans), we should export a `custom` function that users can use to make their types.

```typescript
export function custom<T>(decode: (input: unknown) => T): ShapeCustom<T> {
  return {
    __tag: 'custom',
    decode,
  }
}
```

This way the runtime tag remains an implementation detail that they don't have to worry about. An example usage of this (tests) for the previous Date example is given below:

<Spoiler summary="example 'custom' tests">

Example of an incoming date string that might be one of 3 possibilities, and we'd like to get a `Date` on the other side (or an error):

```typescript
describe('Custom', () => {
  const regexes = [
    /^(?<year>\d{4})-(?<month>\d{2})-(?<day>\d{2})$/, // YYYY-MM-DD
    /^(?<month>\d{2})\/(?<day>\d{2})\/(?<year>\d{4})$/, // MM/DD/YYYY
    /^(?<month>\d{2})_(?<day>\d{2})_(?<year>\d{4})$/, // MM_DD_YYYY
  ]
  function customDateDecoder(input: unknown): Date {
    if (typeof input !== 'string') {
      throw new Error('oopsy whoopsy!')
    }
    for (const regex of regexes) {
      const match = input.match(regex)
      if (match) {
        const year = Number.parseInt(match.groups!['year'])
        const month = Number.parseInt(match.groups!['month'])
        const day = Number.parseInt(match.groups!['day'])
        return new Date(year, month - 1, day) // month starts at zero...
      }
    }
    throw new Error('oopsy whoopsy!')
  }

  test('custom decoder inference', () => {
    const CustomDate = custom(customDateDecoder)
    expect(true).toBe(true)

    type Expected = Date
    type Actual = Infer<typeof CustomDate>

    type _Test = Expect<Equal<Expected, Actual>>
  })

  test('custom decoder functionality', () => {
    const CustomDate = custom(customDateDecoder)

    const testData = [
      // input, expected
      ['2024-11-18', new Date(2024, 10, 18)],
      ['11/18/2024', new Date(2024, 10, 18)],
      ['11_18_2024', new Date(2024, 10, 18)],
    ] as const

    for (const [input, expected] of testData) {
      const actual = CustomDate.decode(input)
      expect(actual).toStrictEqual(expected)
    }
  })
})
```

</Spoiler>

## Input type other than unknown

Up to this point, we've made an assumption that the input data is always an `unknown` type. For the builtin shapes, this was true (and should be true), because the builtins should be able to make all the appropriate runtime checks.
For custom decoders though, it would be nice if the input data could be narrowed in the first place sometimes.

In the previous example, we always were working with a string input that we had gotten from a CSV file<MarginNote id="csv-string">Always treat CSV fields like a string and don't use the "helpful" conversions from the CSV library, or they'll treat some of your zip codes like octal numbers. Ask me how I know</MarginNote>. It's nicer in this case if our `CustomDate` decoder was only allowed to receive a string as input, so we didn't have to check for that.

Thankfully, this is pretty easy. We can update our main `Shape` and `ShapeCustom` types to take an optional type parameter that defaults to `unknown`:

```typescript
interface Shape<T, Input = unknown> {
  readonly __tag: ShapeTag
  readonly decode: (input: Input) => T
}

interface ShapeCustom<T, Input> extends Shape<T, Input> {
  readonly __tag: 'custom'
}
```

We have to add `infer Input` inside the last branch of the `Infer<Shape>` type, even though we aren't using it,

```typescript

export type Infer<S extends Shape<unknown>> = S extends ShapeUnknown
// ...snip...
                  : S extends ShapeCustom<infer T, infer Input>
                    ? T
                    : never
```

and then we update our `custom` function to also take that type parameter, which it will infer from the decoder that's passed in:

```typescript
export function custom<T, Input>(decode: (input: Input) => T): ShapeCustom<T, Input> {
  return {
    __tag: 'custom',
    decode,
  }
}
```

If you added the tests from Part 1 for the custom decoder, you should have type errors now (this is why we test all of our code, including our types!)<MarginNote id="may-or-may-not">Actually you may or may not have type errors, depending on your compiler configuration. More on that below.</MarginNote>.

This is a good time as any to learn about...

<NewConcept title="covariance and contravariance">

[Covariance and contravariance](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)>) are examples of different kinds of **variance**, which describes different ways that subtypes are allowed to interact and what substitutions are considered OK vs. considered a type error. These concepts have been well established in computer science for decades, dating back to the 1980s or possibly earlier.

When working with function types, such as `(a: A) => B`, we have two types that we're dealing with:

1. Parameter/argument type `A`
2. Return type `B`

Let's say that the function has to be constrained to satisfy `A => B`, and we pass in `CoolA => CoolB`. What do we know about the constraints on `CoolA` and `CoolB`?

`B` is in the return position, which means its **covariant**. This means that `CoolB` can be `B` or any _subtype_ of `B`.

`A` is in the parameter position, which is opposite, meaning it is **contravariant**. This means that `CoolA` can be `A` or any _supertype_ of `A`.

</NewConcept>

By default, TypeScript doesn't type check according to these rules. I'm not really sure what it does, but it can be opted in with the [strictFunctionTypes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#strictFunctionTypes) compiler configuration setting which thankfully is included in the "strict" overall setting. But another crazy thing is it depends on the syntax you use for the function type!. For example, if we had written our type like this, then there would be no errors even with the "strict" flags on.

```typescript
interface Shape<T, Input = unknown> {
  readonly __tag: ShapeTag
  decode(input: Input): T // no contravariance checking with this syntax
  // decode: (input: Input) => T // checks parameter type contravariantly
}
```

Feel free to use that approach to suppress errors, but just note that this can cause runtime crashes to easily slip in because it's not actually checking the types correctly. To fix this the right way, we need to update the contraint in our `Infer<Shape>` type.

```typescript
export type Infer<S extends Shape<unknown, never>> = S extends ShapeUnknown
//                                       ^^^^^^^
// ...snip...
```

We pass in `never` for the `Input` type parameter, which appears in the **contravariant** position of the `decode` function. This way, since everything is a supertype of `never`, users will be able to define their own input type (or more accurately, we can infer their input type from the decoder that they provide).

## Better error handling

Part 1 contained a section on the rationale of why our current library design is not friendly to users, but to repeat and expand:

1. We're just using the string `"oopsy whoopsy!"` on every error, which is obviously not useful, because it doesn't tell the user anything about what happened
2. Exceptions are invisible in the type system, defeating the purpose of static typing. The `decode` function **claims** to always give back a `T`, but that's not true
3. Decoding errors are not exceptional, in principle, any time we're dealing with external data we should expect that it may not confirm to the desired shape
4. Even if it was exceptional, that's not a decision for a general library to make. The users of our library (application developers) are who determines what is exceptional or not, based on their domain knowledge

So what can we do? In some other languages, there's a data structure in the standard library that represents the result of a fallible function (often called `Result`), but that doesn't exist in JavaScript/TypeScript. We could import one from a third party library, but this tutorial is supposed to be from scratch, so we'll make it ourself!

One way to do it is like this:

```typescript
type Result<T, Err> = [T, null] | [null, Err]
```

This maybe works, but doesn't distinguish well the possibility that an operation succeeds but has nothing to return (analogous to an HTTP 204 - succeeded with no content). Or that an operation failed but there's no meaningful error to give, such as searching for an item in an array, the only way it fails is if the item isn't in the array so it's not worth having a runtime value for that. Maybe these are issues in theory but not in practice ðŸ¤·

### A `Result` tagged union

I prefer to leave less "room for error"<SideNote id="room-for-error">Or more precisely, to keep the error in a separate room from the success</SideNote> and have something with an explicit tag.

```typescript
type ResultSuccess<T> = { tag: 'success'; value: T }
type ResultError<Err> = { tag: 'error'; error: Err }
type Result<T, Err> = ResultSuccess<T> | ResultError<Err>
```

This will work fine. We can provide a couple of helper functions, but it's not strictly necessary:

```typescript
function success<T>(value: T): ResultSuccess<T> {
  return { tag: 'success', value }
}

function isSuccess<T, Err>(result: Result<T, Err>): result is ResultSuccess<T> {
  return result.tag === 'success'
}

function error<Err>(error: Err): ResultError<Err> {
  return { tag: 'error', error }
}

function isError<T, Err>(result: Result<T, Err>): result is ResultError<Err> {
  return result.tag === 'error'
}

// if you added this code to a separate module, export this
const Result = {
  success,
  isSuccess,
  error,
  isError,
} as const
```

This can be expanded/improved, but this will suit the purposes of this tutorial.

<KnowledgeCheck>

Try to implement a `map` and `flatMap` function.

The `map` function should a `Result<T>` and a function `T => U` and give back a `Result<U>`.

The `flatMap` function should take a `Result<T>` and a function `T => Result<U>` and give back a `Result<U>`.

Congrats! You made a monad. Bask in your superiority.

</KnowledgeCheck>

Time to cause a bunch of red squigglies! Let's update our type signature of `decode` to indicate that it is fallible.

```typescript
interface Shape<T, Input = unknown> {
  readonly __tag: ShapeTag
  readonly decode: (input: Input) => Result<T, unknown>
}
```

So the only problem now is... What is `Err` in this case? For now, let's define an empty type and we'll build it up as we learn what we need. We can also define an alias for convenience (this is optional).

```typescript
type DecodeError = {}
type DecodeResult<T> = Result<T, DecodeError>

interface Shape<T, Input = unknown> {
  readonly __tag: ShapeTag
  readonly decode: (input: Input) => DecodeResult<T>
}
```

The first error to resolve is on the unknown shape<MarginNote id="tests-with-compile-errors">Depending on your test setup, you may still be able to run tests when there are compiler errors. This can be pretty useful for situations like this where there's an "infectious" change causing a lot of errors, the tests can help verify the refactor in each location</MarginNote>, this one is straight-forward given what we've learned so far:

```typescript
export const unknown: ShapeUnknown = {
  __tag: 'unknown',
  decode: (input: unknown) => Result.success(input),
} as const
```

<EmphasisBox>

Unlike Part 1, the test code won't be provided, but it's highly recommended to follow along by updating your tests as you go.

However, for reference, feel free to check out the test code in the `part-2` tag of the repository: [https://github.com/davimiku/ts-io-decoding-encoding#part-2](https://github.com/davimiku/ts-io-decoding-encoding/tree/part-2).

When writing your tests, make sure to add plenty of cases for the failure scenarios!

</EmphasisBox>

### Booleans

Now for the boolean decoder, it can only fail in one way, which is if the input is not a boolean. As we kind of hinted earlier, in **some** cases when there's only one mode of failure, you don't _have_ to provide any additional detail. However, here, we still should, because even though the boolean only has one mode of failure, it will be **composed** inside of other decoders and we should provide context for the user, especially because an array/record/struct can have multiple failures.

ex. for a struct with a `coolFlag` field, the error might end up looking like `{ coolFlag: 'expected boolean, got string' }`

```typescript
type DecodeError = string
//                 ^^^^^^

// ...snip...

export const boolean: ShapeBoolean = {
  __tag: 'boolean',
  decode: (input: unknown): DecodeResult<boolean> => {
    if (typeof input !== 'boolean') {
      return Result.error(`expected 'boolean', got '${typeof input}'`)
    }
    return Result.success(input)
  },
} as const
```

<EmphasisBox>

Oh shucks, `typeof null` returns `'object'`! This means our users will see "got 'object'" when the input data was null. Maybe this is technically correct, but it is likely confusing to our users.

I made a custom `typeOf` function to deal with this edge case, though this is optional. The builtin `typeof` unary operator still needs to be used to narrow the type, this is only for constructing the error message.

```typescript
function typeOf(input: unknown): string {
  if (input === null) {
    return 'null'
  }
  return typeof input
}
```

Replace the `got '${typeof input}'` with `got '${typeOf(input)}'` if you'd like. That way, users will see "got 'null'" instead of "got 'object'".

</EmphasisBox>

<KnowledgeCheck>

Two random design thoughts about this decoder:

1. Does the return type of `decode` here need to be written out explicitly or could it be inferred? What are the trade-offs to both choices?
2. We're executing `typeof input` twice. Performance is not an issue unless it's proven by a good benchmark to actually be a bottleneck, but for the sake of academic curiosity, does this still work if you pull out `typeof input` to a separate variable so it only executes once? Why or why not?

</KnowledgeCheck>

### Numbers

The number decoder has three ways of failing:

```typescript
export const number: ShapeNumber = {
  __tag: 'number',
  decode(input: unknown): DecodeResult<number> {
    if (typeof input !== 'number') {
      return Result.error(`expected 'number', got '${typeOf(input)}'`)
    }
    if (Number.isNaN(input)) {
      return Result.error(`expected 'number', got 'NaN'`)
    }
    if (!Number.isFinite(input)) {
      return Result.error(`expected finite 'number', got '${input}'`)
    }

    return Result.success(input)
  },
}
```

<KnowledgeCheck>

Updating the `bigint` decoder is an "exercise for the reader", because it depends on the design decisions you made in Part 1 on what input was allowed or not allowed.

</KnowledgeCheck>

### Strings

The decoder for string is straight-forward as well.

```typescript
export const string: ShapeString = {
  __tag: 'string',
  decode(idnput: unknown): DecodeResult<string> {
    if (typeof input !== 'string') {
      return Result.error(`expected 'string', got '${typeOf(input)}'`)
    }
    return Result.success(input)
  },
}
```

### Arrays

Now we get more interesting, because for arrays there's two sources of failure:

1. The data being decoded itself is not an array
2. One or more of the elements of the array fail their own decoding

If it's the first failure, a simple string still suffices, no additional context is needed besides what we'll include in the message. However, for the second failure, we need to provide more context to the user on which elements failed decoding.

We need to update our `DecodeError` to have the potential to carry more information:

```typescript
type DecodeError = string | { [key: string]: string | DecodeError }
```

Just like we've seen a bunch of times throughout this tutorial, this is **recursion** in action which has (at least) a base case and (at least) a recursive case.

<KnowledgeCheck>

Why can't the [Record utility type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#recordkeys-type) be used here?

</KnowledgeCheck>

Down to the array function, the new signature is:

```typescript
export function array<S extends Shape<unknown>>(elementShape: S): ShapeArray<S> {
  return {
    __tag: 'array',
    decode(input: unknown): DecodeResult<Infer<S>[]> {
      // ...snip...
    },
  }
}
```

Try implementing this yourself, referencing the information from the beginning of this section. When you're finished, or if you're stuck, feel free to check the sample implementation in the spoiler below.

If we encounter an error on the Xth element, we shouldn't stop like we did before (previously, we were throwing an exception, which aborted the decoding). It will be useful for people if we check all the data and return **all** errors that were encountered. For example, for a string array shape our errors could end up being something like this which would tell our users which elements did not decode successfully.

```typescript
{
  "9": "expected 'string', got 'null'",
  "16": "expected 'string', got 'object'"
}
```

<Spoiler summary="example - array decode implementation">

Below is one approach to implementing this. This is an procedural/imperative approach using mutation, which is completely fine by me. JavaScript/TypeScript support multiple paradigms, and using more "functional" code isn't always the most readable in this language.

```typescript
export function array<S extends Shape<unknown>>(elementShape: S): ShapeArray<S> {
  return {
    __tag: 'array',
    decode(input: unknown): DecodeResult<Infer<S>[]> {
      if (!Array.isArray(input)) {
        return Result.error(`expected 'Array', got '${typeOf(input)}'`)
      }

      const errors: DecodeError = {}
      // micro-optimization: preallocate because we know the length
      const output = Array<Infer<S>>(input.length)

      for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
        const result = elementShape.decode(input[i])
        if (Result.isSuccess(result)) {
          output[i] = result.value as Infer<S>
        } else {
          errors[i] = result.error
        }
      }

      if (Object.keys(errors).length > 0) {
        return Result.error(errors)
      }

      return Result.success(output)
    },
  }
}
```

Fun Fact: We're allowed to use the **number** `i` to index into an object because JavaScript [coerces properties to strings](https://262.ecma-international.org/#sec-topropertykey) when used in get or set operations, so we don't have to coerce it ourselves. We could, if we wanted to.

</Spoiler>

### Records

As with Part 1, records and arrays are similar to each other<MarginNote id="exponential-types">In type theory, both of these are [exponential types](https://josevillegas.substack.com/p/swift-sum-types-product-types), which is why the implementation for us is a similar idea. I couldn't find a source that directly writes about this, maybe a topic for a future article</MarginNote>.

Similar to before, try implementing it yourself by updating what we have currently to an implementation that **collects** errors, and returns success if no errors were found.

For example, when decoding a record of number values, let's say we encountered a string value for the key "not a number", the error output would look like this:

```js
{ "not a number": "expected 'number', got 'string'" }
```

<Spoiler summary="example - record decode implementation">

Very similar procedural/imperative implementation, the only difference is a string key is used rather than a numeric index.

```typescript
export function record<S extends Shape<unknown>>(valueShape: S): ShapeRecord<S> {
  return {
    __tag: 'record',
    decode(input: unknown): DecodeResult<Record<string, Infer<S>>> {
      if (!input || typeof input !== 'object' || Array.isArray(input)) {
        return Result.error(`expected 'Object', got '${typeOf(input)}'`)
      }

      const errors: DecodeError = {}
      const output: Record<string, Infer<S>> = {}

      for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(input)) {
        const result = valueShape.decode(value)
        if (Result.isSuccess(result)) {
          output[key] = result.value as Infer<S>
        } else {
          errors[key] = result.error
        }
      }

      if (Object.keys(errors).length > 0) {
        return Result.error(errors)
      }

      return Result.success(output)
    },
  } as const
}
```

</Spoiler>

### Structs

Again, the runtime code for structs is similar to records because at runtime they are the same thing. The type annotations will be different because our distinction between these two concepts lives in the type context.

Same idea as in Part 1 - run the `record` decoder first to verify the incoming data is at least a record. Then, decode each field individually. The error output should be the same format as records, since the runtime code is basically the same thing.

<Spoiler summary="example - struct decode implementation">

This implementation uses the `flatMap` that was an optional exercise earlier, so that's not mandatory. Instead of `flatMap`, you can manually check the result of the record decoder and return the error if it's an error, and otherwise unwrap the success value and pass it to the next computation. This is just a demonstration of how `flatMap` can help you **compose** operations together with less boilerplate<MarginNote id="different-style">It's a different style of programming that's not for everyone, but it's worth trying in general to see if you like it or not</MarginNote>.

```typescript
const UnknownRecord = record(unknown)

export function struct<Fields extends StructFields>(fieldShapes: Fields): ShapeStruct<Fields> {
  return {
    __tag: 'struct',
    decode(input: unknown): DecodeResult<InferStruct<Fields>> {
      return Result.flatMap(UnknownRecord.decode(input), record =>
        decodeRecordToStruct(record, fieldShapes)
      )
    },
  } as const
}

function decodeRecordToStruct<Fields extends StructFields>(
  data: Record<string, unknown>,
  fieldShapes: Fields
): DecodeResult<InferStruct<Fields>> {
  const output = {} as InferStruct<Fields>
  const errors: DecodeError = {}

  for (const [key, shape] of Object.entries(fieldShapes)) {
    const result = shape.decode(data[key])
    if (Result.isSuccess(result)) {
      output[key as keyof Fields] = result.value as Infer<Fields[keyof Fields]>
    } else {
      errors[key] = result.error
    }
  }

  if (Object.keys(errors).length > 0) {
    return Result.error(errors)
  }

  return Result.success(output)
}
```

</Spoiler>

<EmphasisBox>

Should **extra** fields when decoding a struct be a failure?

If not, should these extra fields be removed or copied into the decoded struct?

What should the default behavior be? If a user wanted to opt-in to a different behavior, how could this library support that?

</EmphasisBox>

### Unions

The actual validations have already been written in Part 1, but we need to modify it to return an error result rather than throwing for each case.

On the happy path, after the tag has been determined, we need to make sure we run the decoder for the payload corresponding to the given tag, and make sure that error gets propagated appropriately.

In this case, I choose to use the tag as the key of the error object, such that if the tag was `"click"` but the payload didn't successfully decode (let's say it was supposed to be a `ClickEvent` struct that was missing a field named `x`), then this error would be returned like:

```js

<Spoiler summary="example - union decode implementation">

This implementation makes use of the `Result.map` from the exercise earlier and a new `Result.mapError` that does the same thing but for the error variant. Similar to the previous note, it's not necessary to do this, you can "unwrap" / "re-wrap" the value or error as needed with only the capabilities provided in the tutorial.

```typescript
export function union<Variants extends UnionVariants>(variants: Variants): ShapeUnion<Variants> {
  return {
    __tag: 'union',
    decode(input: unknown): DecodeResult<InferUnion<Variants>> {
      if (!Array.isArray(input) || input.length !== 2) {
        return Result.error('expected a 2-tuple with the tag as the first element')
      }

      const [tag, value] = input as [unknown, unknown]

      if (typeof tag !== 'string') {
        return Result.error(`expected the tag to be a 'string', got ${typeOf(tag)}`)
      }

      if (!Object.keys(variants).includes(tag)) {
        return Result.error('expected the tag to match one of the provided variants')
      }

      const result = variants[tag].decode(value)

      return Result.mapError(
        Result.map(result, value => [tag, value as Infer<Variants[typeof tag]>]),
        error => ({ [tag]: error })
      )
    },
  }
}
```

### Custom Decoders

No major change! We update the signature of the `custom` function and that's about it. The users of our library who define custom encoders are responsible for returning a `Result` depending on their use case.

```typescript
export function custom<T, Input>(decode: (input: Input) => DecodeResult<T>): ShapeCustom<T, Input> {
  return {
    __tag: 'custom',
    decode,
  }
}
```

export default function ({ children }) {
  return <ArticlePage meta={meta}>{children}</ArticlePage>
}
