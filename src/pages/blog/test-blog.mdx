Quiz: Which value is missing?

Number is not quite straightforward in Rust, the available types are more granular. While the [Number in Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number) (and JSON!)
represents a `double` value, or in other words a 64-bit floating value as described in [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754).

For our purposes, we will explore how to capture JSON numbers in two ways, as an integer `i64` and as a floating value `f64`.
