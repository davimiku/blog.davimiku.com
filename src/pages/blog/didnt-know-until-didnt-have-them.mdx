## Closures

Of course functions are closures. Why wouldn't they be?

## First Class Functions

Of course functions can be assigned to variables? Why wouldn't you be able to do that?


## Higher Order Functions

Of course functions can be passed into other functions and returned from functions. 
Why wouldn't that be allowed?

Example: eventlisteners. `map/filter` array functions.

Example: `useEffect` hook returning a function.
