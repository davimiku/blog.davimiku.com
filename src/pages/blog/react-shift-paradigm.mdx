## Component-based Design

Big template files (AngularJS) - https://code.angularjs.org/snapshot-stable/docs/tutorial/step_10
Templates come before Components in the tutorial

"Components" is the first listed Core Concept in the newer version and buried towards the bottom in older versions.

> By the way, unless component orientation is front and center in your framework, you won't think this way. In fact, unless your framework not only encourages, but makes it easy to create components, you won't. For example, Angular definitely has the concept of components in the form of directives. This is great, except that creating directives is not trivial.
> To create directives you need to have a deep understanding of how Angular's runtime is managed (compiling vs linking), how scope inheritance works (isolated vs. parent vs. child), and possibly what transclusion is. And so, many Angular devs simply ignore directives and use templates instead (I certainly was in this category until fairly recently).

> The thing is that View-part in React is replaced with so-called Component. [...] Let’s go back to our Component which is the main React’s object

React: Rethinking Best Practices

> When you start to build abstractions on top of HTML, you start to have to invent a lot of things in order to get to the level of expressiveness you need to build real applications.
> The framework is telling you how to separate your components and the vocabulary you're speaking is that of the framework and not of your application.

> Use components to separate your concerns

React: Rethinking Best Practices

> Data changing over time is the root of all evil.

> Our intellectual patterns are rather geared to master static relations and our powers to visualize processes
> evolving in time are relatively poorly developed.
