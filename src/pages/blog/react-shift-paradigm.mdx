## Component-based Design


Big template files (AngularJS) - https://code.angularjs.org/snapshot-stable/docs/tutorial/step_10
Templates come before Components in the tutorial

"Components" is the first listed Core Concept in the newer version and buried towards the bottom in older versions.

> By the way, unless component orientation is front and center in your framework, you won't think this way. In fact, unless your framework not only encourages, but makes it easy to create components, you won't. For example, Angular definitely has the concept of components in the form of directives. This is great, except that creating directives is not trivial.
> To create directives you need to have a deep understanding of how Angular's runtime is managed (compiling vs linking), how scope inheritance works (isolated vs. parent vs. child), and possibly what transclusion is. And so, many Angular devs simply ignore directives and use templates instead (I certainly was in this category until fairly recently).

> The thing is that View-part in React is replaced with so-called Component. [...] Let’s go back to our Component which is the main React’s object
