## Library Design


<EmphasisBox>

Examples of real libraries are referenced throughout this article, with both associated praise and criticism. 
I wanted to include as many real examples as possible to complement theoretical/contrived examples. This is by no
means a criticism of the hard-working people who develop and maintain these libraries, often on their own time
and effort. I just hope that some of this discussion is helpful for others.

</EmphasisBox>

## Correctness

- Library functions accept only correct inputs, within what is possible to achieve in that language
- Return types of library functions say exactly what they can possibly return
- Correctness is opt-out, not opt-in


### Example: Date(Time) Parsing

A common operation in applications, both on the client-side and server-side, is parsing an input string
into date/datetime structures for doing various operations, such as comparisons, duration calculations, etc.

In the general case, parsing input can either succeed or fail, there is no guarantee the input string is in an
expected format. The input could have come from users, may have been received from a network request, etc.

(Diagram of Input -> Success OR Failure)

[Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimefromiso)

```ts
fromISO(text: string, opts: Object): DateTime
```

The function signature provided by the Luxon documentation means a function named `fromISO` that takes a `string` and `Object` as inputs and
returns a `DateTime` as output. The interesting thing to note here is this function signature has no notion of failure - a `DateTime` is
always returned for all inputs.



[Dotnet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime.parse?view=net-7.0#system-datetime-parse(system-string))

```cs
public static DateTime Parse (string s);
```

This function signature (C#) means a function named `Parse` takes a `string` as inputs and returns a `DateTime` as output (the output is listed
before the input which seems backwards to me, but that's how the syntax works).

From reading the function signature, it appears that a `DateTime` is always returned.
